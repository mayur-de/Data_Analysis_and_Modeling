> # **_EDA and Machine Learning : Global Road Accidents_**

> ## Overview
- This document provides a comprehensive EDA of a dataset containing **132,000 accident entries** over **30 columns**.
- Machine learning models are applied to classify and predict various target variables related to road accidents.

> ## EDA: Key Findings
- **Data Inspection**: No null values or duplicates were found. Data types were adjusted, and a new 'Date' feature was created.
- **High-Level Data Overview**:
  - Numerical variables showed low correlations.
  - Categorical variables' frequency distributions were visualized.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Accident Data**: 
    - Total accidents: **132,000**
    - Total fatalities: **263,398**
    - Total injuries: **1,255,083**
    - Total accidents involving alcohol: **12,500** (approx. 9.5% of total accidents)
  - **Economic Impact**: 
    - Total medical cost: **$3.3 billion**
    - Total economic loss: **$6.6 billion**
  - **Emergency Response**:
    - Average emergency response time: **32.49 minutes**
    - Percentage of accidents with delayed emergency response (over 60 minutes): **8%**
  - **Temporal Analysis**:
    - Accidents peaked in **July** with **11,500** accidents recorded.
    - The **highest severity** was recorded on **weekdays**, particularly between **4 PM - 7 PM**.

> ## Analysis Insights
- **Temporal Trends**: Accident trends were analyzed by year, month, and time of day, revealing patterns in severity and impact.
- **Geographic Trends**: Accident severity and impact were analyzed by country and urban/rural areas.
- **Driver & Vehicle Factors**: Driver age, gender, fatigue, and alcohol levels were analyzed for their role in accident severity.
- **Environmental & Road Conditions**: Weather, road type, conditions, and traffic volume were considered in relation to accident severity.
- **Severity & Impact**: Relationships between accident severity, causes, and vehicle involvement were examined.
