> # **Cost and Profit Analysis: Food Delivery Platform**

> ## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes the financial and operational aspects of a food delivery platform to:
- Assess the cost structure.
- Identify inefficiencies.
- Recommend strategies to enhance profitability.

By analyzing transactional data, the project:
- Identifies key cost drivers.
- Quantifies revenue performance.
- Provides actionable recommendations to optimize operations and improve net income.

> ## **Recommendations for Platform to Increase Profitability**
1. **Reduce Discounts**: Discounts constitute nearly half of the total costs.
2. **Increase Commission Fees**: Strong correlation with net income.
3. **Optimize Refund Rates**: High refund rates negatively impact profitability.
4. **Encourage Larger Order Values**: Larger orders positively influence net income.
5. **Revise Delivery Fee Structure**: Reassess fee coverage to minimize cost burdens.
6. **Minimize Processing Fees**: Optimize payment gateway agreements.

> ## **Data Description**
The dataset consists of transactional records for 1,000 orders from the food delivery platform, covering essential financial and operational metrics.

### **Key Features:**
- **Order Details**: Unique identifiers, timestamps, and customer/restaurant information.
- **Financial Metrics**: Order value, delivery fees, discounts, and refunds.
- **Revenue Sources**: Commission fees and payment details.

| Order Value              | Total value of the food items in the order (before fees and discounts)     |
| Delivery Fee             | Fee charged for delivering the order (cost to the platform)               |
| Payment Method           | Mode of payment used by the customer                                      |

| Refunds/Chargebacks      | Amount refunded or charged back due to disputes or cancellations (cost)   |

> ### **Feature Engineering:**
- **Discount Percentage (Disc Pct)**: Extracted from 'Discounts and Offers'.
- **Discount Amount**: Calculated as discount percentage multiplied by order value.
- **Cost**: Summed 'Delivery Fee', 'Discount Amount', 'Payment Processing Fee', and 'Refunds/Chargebacks'.
- **Revenue**: Defined as 'Commission Fee'.
- **Net Income**: Calculated as 'Revenue' minus 'Cost'.
- **Date**: Extracted date from 'Order Date and Time'.

> ## **Key Findings**
> ### **Financial Performance**
- **Total Loss**: ₹34,051.85.
- **Revenue-to-Cost Ratio**: 0.79 (₹0.79 earned for every ₹1 spent).
- **Average Cost per Order**: ₹161.04, while revenue per order is ₹126.99.
- **Net-Income-to-Revenue Ratio**: -0.27, indicating 27% of revenue is insufficient to cover costs.
- **Revenue Share**: Revenue constitutes only 12% of the average order value.

> ### **Cost Drivers**
- Discounts account for **46.13%** of total costs, averaging ₹74.29 per order.
- Refund rate is **28.5%**, significantly impacting operational efficiency.
- Delivery fees impact **81.4%** of orders.

> ### **Profitability Insights**
- **61.8%** of orders are loss-making, while **37.9%** are profitable.
- Profit-making orders feature lower discounts, fewer refunds, and higher commission fees.
